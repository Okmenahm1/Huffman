# Huffman Coding Project

This project implements **Huffman Coding** for file compression and decompression.

## üîß Features

- Encodes and decodes files using Huffman Coding
- Stores the header with character frequencies instead of the tree
- Basic compression and decompression of text files

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

- Header is based on **frequency table**, not the Huffman tree itself
- Some files may **not decode correctly** due to header structure or edge cases
